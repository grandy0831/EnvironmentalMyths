# Environmental Myths: The Fusion of Ancient Mythology and Modern Technology

## Project Overview
This project brings together ancient Chinese myths and modern technology to demonstrate how ancient people interpreted natural phenomena. Utilising sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, and wind, it transforms this environmental data into dynamic displays through artistic installations featuring mechanical structures. This innovative approach not only educates the public about traditional culture and environmental changes but also revitalises ancient stories, fostering an appreciation for cultural heritage and environmental science.

## Research Questions
**Main Question:**
- How can traditional Chinese myths be integrated with modern environmental sensor technology to visualise changes in the environment?

**Sub-Questions:**
- How can a reliable outdoor environmental monitoring device be designed and constructed for long-term operation?
- How can artistic installations be designed to display environmental data captured by sensors?
