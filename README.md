# Environmental Myths: The Fusion of Ancient Mythology and Modern Technology

## Introduction
Ancient peoples employed mythological narratives to interpret natural phenomena, which not only reflected their understanding of the world but also embodied rich cultural values and deep philosophical insights. These stories have shaped human worldviews and values over centuries. Despite the precision of modern science in explaining natural phenomena, the significance of ancient interpretations should not be overlooked or forgotten. By integrating modern environmental sensor technology, real-time environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed can be monitored. This data not only offers scientific explanations for natural phenomena but also merges with ancient myths to reinterpret these old stories through a new perspective and form, rejuvenating them in contemporary society.

## Research Objective
The primary research question driving this project is: "How can traditional Chinese myths be integrated with modern environmental sensor technology to visualize changes in the environment?" Additionally, this project explores how artistic installations can be designed to display environmental data captured by sensors, enhancing the educational and cultural understanding of traditional narratives alongside modern environmental challenges.

## Project Overview
This project brings together ancient Chinese myths and modern technology to demonstrate how ancient people interpreted natural phenomena. Utilising sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, and wind, it transforms this environmental data into dynamic displays through artistic installations featuring mechanical structures. This innovative approach not only educates the public about traditional culture and environmental changes but also revitalises ancient stories, fostering an appreciation for cultural heritage and environmental science.
