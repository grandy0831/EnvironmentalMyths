# Environmental Myths: The Fusion of Ancient Mythology and Modern Technology

## Introduction
Ancient peoples used mythological stories to explain natural phenomena, which not only reflected their understanding of the world but also contained rich cultural values and deep philosophical thinking. These stories shaped people's worldviews and values to some extent. The development of modern science has provided a precise scientific basis for understanding natural phenomena, yet this does not mean that we should ignore or forget those ancient interpretations and stories. By integrating modern environmental sensor technology, we can monitor and obtain environmental data in real time. This data not only scientifically explains natural phenomena but also merges with ancient myths, reinterpreting these old stories in new perspectives and forms, bringing them back to life in contemporary society.

## Research Questions
**Main Question:**
- How can traditional Chinese myths be integrated with modern environmental sensor technology to visualise changes in the environment?

**Sub-Questions:**
- How can a reliable outdoor environmental monitoring device be designed and constructed for long-term operation?
- How can artistic installations be designed to display environmental data captured by sensors?

## Project Overview
This project brings together ancient Chinese myths and modern technology to demonstrate how ancient people interpreted natural phenomena. Utilising sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, and wind, it transforms this environmental data into dynamic displays through artistic installations featuring mechanical structures. This innovative approach not only educates the public about traditional culture and environmental changes but also revitalises ancient stories, fostering an appreciation for cultural heritage and environmental science.
