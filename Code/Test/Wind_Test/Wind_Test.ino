Anemometer Tutorial

This code takes the output from an Adafruit anemometer (product ID 1733) and converts it into a wind speed.

//Setup Variables

const int sensorPin = A0;  //Defines the pin that the anemometer output is connected to
int sensorValue = 0;       //Variable stores the value direct from the analog pin
float sensorVoltage = 0;   //Variable that stores the voltage (in Volts) from the anemometer being sent to the analog pin
float windSpeed = 0;       // Wind speed in meters per second (m/s)

float voltageConversionConstant = .004882814;  //This constant maps the value provided from the analog read function, which ranges from 0 to 1023, to actual voltage, which ranges from 0V to 5V
int sensorDelay = 1000;                        //Delay between sensor readings, measured in milliseconds (ms)

//Anemometer Technical Variables
//The following variables correspond to the anemometer sold by Adafruit, but could be modified to fit other anemometers.

float voltageMin = .62;   // Mininum output voltage from anemometer in mV.
float windSpeedMin = 0;  // Wind speed in meters/sec corresponding to minimum voltage

float voltageMax = 2.0;   // Maximum output voltage from anemometer in mV.
float windSpeedMax = 32;  // Wind speed in meters/sec corresponding to maximum voltage



void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);  //Start the serial connection
}


void loop() {
  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);  //Get a value between 0 and 1023 from the analog pin connected to the anemometer

  sensorVoltage = sensorValue * voltageConversionConstant;  //Convert sensor value to actual voltage

  //Convert voltage value to wind speed using range of max and min voltages and wind speed for the anemometer
  if (sensorVoltage <= voltageMin) {
    windSpeed = 0;  //Check if voltage is below minimum value. If so, set wind speed to zero.
  } else {
    windSpeed = (sensorVoltage - voltageMin) * windSpeedMax / (voltageMax - voltageMin);  //For voltages above minimum value, use the linear relationship to calculate wind speed.
  }

  //Print voltage and windspeed to serial
  Serial.print("Voltage: ");
  Serial.print(sensorVoltage);
  Serial.print("\t");
  Serial.print("Wind speed: ");
  Serial.println(windSpeed);

  delay(sensorDelay);
